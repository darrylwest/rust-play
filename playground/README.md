# Rust ECDSA Libraries

* ring: A low-level cryptographic library that provides ECDSA support.
* subtle: A cryptographic library that focuses on correctness and security. It provides ECDSA support and other cryptographic primitives.
* webpki: A library for working with X.509 certificates and other public key infrastructure (PKI) objects. It provides ECDSA support and other PKI-related functionality.


I (bard) recommend using subtle in Rust.
